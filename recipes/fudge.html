    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the best fudge recipe ever! It's my aunt's recipe, passed down through
         the family. It's better than any fudge I've ever had at the Jersey shore and
          easy enough to whip up in 15 minutes or so.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1 and 1/2 cups white sugar</li>

        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
