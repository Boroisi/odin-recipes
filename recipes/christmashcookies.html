    <h1>Best Soft Christmas Cookies</h1>

    <img src="../img/christcookies.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Christmas cookie recipe for soft sugar cutouts that I have used for 
        years. I sprinkle the cookies with colored sugar before baking; you can 
        also frost them with icing when cool.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 3/4 all-prupose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup margarina, softened</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step</strong></p>
            <p>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl;
                 set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step</strong></p>
            <p>Beat sugar and margarine in a large bowl with an electric mixer 
                until smooth. Beat first egg into butter mixture. Beat second egg 
                into mixture along with vanilla extract; add flour mixture and stir
                 until dough is just combined. Wrap dough; chill in the refrigerator 
                 for 2 hours.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step</strong></p>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease two cookie 
                sheets.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step</strong></p>
            <p>Roll out dough on a clean floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness. 
                Cut out shapes using cookie cutters; arrange them on the prepared 
                cookie sheets. Gather scraps and repeat this step.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step</strong></p>
            <p>Bake in batches in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 
                about 6 to 8 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet briefly before 
                removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
